# Datasets 
- Dataset1:circR2Disease
- Dataset2:Circ2Disease
- Dataset3:circRNA disease
- Dataset4:CircFunBase

# Dependency
- Python 3.8 (64-bit)
- Torch 1.11.0 in Python
- Numpy 1.20.3 in Python
- Gensim 3.6.0

# Model
+ dataset: Store the dataset and MeSH ID.
+ embedding: Computing the similarity matrix of circRNAs and diseases.
+ Feature: Store intermediate embedding matrices.
+ MVGNCDA: Run the MVGNCDA prediction method.


# Usage
+ Step 1: Refer to embedding/readme.md to calculate multiple similarity matrices in turn.
+ Step 2: Run the MVGNCDA program to identify potential circRNA-disease associations.
